# Results of my work with Git

**Kubai Dmytro**

I have improved my Github working skills.  
At first, I created a new private repository on Github and made an initial commit. 
Then I created few branches (master, develop, images, styles) and files in each of them. 
So, I created an empty index.html file in the develop branch. Added some images and changed index.html in the images branch. 
Created styles.css file  on branch styles and linked it to index.html in the styles branch. After each action, I made a commit. 
Then I merged the image and styles branches into the development branch and resolved the merge conflict caused by the index.html file. 
And then I merged the develop branch into master and pushed all the changes to Github. 
Also, using the command 'git reflog', I created a report file called 'task1.1_GIT.txt' and also pushed it to the repository.

**How do I understand DevOps**

DevOps allows us to improve development efficiency and product quality through SDLC automation. 
You can reduce time to market and improve the Mean Time to Recovery. 
For example, you can pack the entire service into one package and then deploy it in seconds. 
DevOps tools enable us to develop software more flexibly, deploy updates faster, improve product stability and security, and reduce development risks.
